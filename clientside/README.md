## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I've not used all the fancy redux states and react router, just a very beginner friendly frontend.

## :pushpin: Setup
- Run ``npm install`` to install all the dependencies
- Run ``npm start`` to run the app in development mode
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
