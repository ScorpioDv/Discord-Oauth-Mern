## :page_with_curl: Sidenote

The target audience for this project is beginners, just a skeleton to get you going. This project is not for production build, I've not secured it since that's not the point. I hope you learn a lot from this repo and make great projects out of it. For further research and security practices links are in ``Resources`` section.
